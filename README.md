# MultiRangeSliderView

## MultiRangeSliderView is a MultiSliderView with some added functionality. It is intented to be used as a sample-portion-specifier tool when overlayed on top of for example a SoundFileView.

* ThumbLength can be set individually per slider. Controllable by holding *shift*.
* Each slider has a startRange-maximum. Controllable by holding *ctrl*.
* Each slider has a endRange-minimum. Controllable by holding *alt*.
* All values are readable by getting the sliders array variable.

## TODO:

* Make support for vertical flow style.
* Include more setters and getters
